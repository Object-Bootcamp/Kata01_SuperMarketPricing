- three for a dollar (so whatâ€™s the amount if I buy 4, or 5?)
- $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
- buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a amount?



- As a user, I should be charged for products as per quantity I will be purchasing 

Will not work following as per current modelling: 

- What if multiple scheme applicable to same product? As creating separate discount products in case if quantity, this is something need to consider.     
- First use case, three for a dollar, then what's price if bought 4, needs to be solved.
